Check the mod's configuration in SADX Mod Manager for more details. You can also select a specific character voice to be used in menus, like with Dreamcast character voice packs.

==CHANGES FROM THE OLD DREAMCAST DLCS MOD==
-The mod has been rewritten from scratch to work more like the original game's DLC system
-Text strings in all languages used in original DLC content have been preserved
-DLC content can now load in Adventure, Trial or Mission Mode
-Added Tikal's challenge
-Lighting accuracy updates
-Custom codepage support: add system\dlc\codepage.ini with "FrenchCodepage=...." etc. to make French, Spanish or German strings use a codepage other than 1252
-Famitsu and QUO challenges no longer replace Station Square camera files with their counterparts from the original 1998 release of SA1
-Twinkle Circuit options for characters have been removed - you can now use the "Mercury GP" menu to go to any course with any character
-The "Alternative challenge timer GUI" option has been removed in favor of a more accurate SA1-like timer
-Seasonal DLC options have been rearranged
-Workarounds from the old mod to prevent DLC content from interfering with story progression have not been reimplemented

==USING THE MOD TO DEVELOP DREAMCAST DLC==
This mod uses DLC data that is compatible with DLC Tool in SA Tools. You can take any folder* from system\dlc and create a VMS file that will work on the Dreamcast version of SA1. You can edit the files in those folders or change files.ini in system\dlc to load DLC content from a different folder. Use the TestSpawn mod to test object placement. Set the "Disable during story" option to false in the mod config if you use Test Spawn.
*Some challenges, such as AT&T, might not work after rebuilding them for the DC version, I haven't figured out why yet.

==DIFFERENCES FROM THE DREAMCAST VERSION==
General differences:
-Save functionality is not available
-The timer becomes semi-transparent when subtitles are displayed
-Sound assets stored in MLT files had to be converted to ADX files or DAT soundbanks to work with SADXPC
-Music changes persist across different acts
-Some DLC folders include the file "renderinfo.ini" to tell the game which functions to use to render models
-The mod detects whether you're playing with Dreamcast Conversion or not, and adjusts some SADX assets to make them compatible with DLC content

Samba GP:

-Super Sonic racing plays for all characters, not just Sonic
-Added an optional "Mercury GP" menu to make it possible to play through all Twinkle Circuit tracks (course names other than Samba GP are unofficial)
