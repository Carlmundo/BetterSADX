HD GUI 2 mod by PkR, Dark Sonic, Sonikko & SPEEPSHighway

This mod provides high-resolution graphics for most ingame menus and GUI items. For use with 1280x720 or higher.

This mod will look best if the game's rendering resolution and window size match your native screen resolution. It is not meant to be used with upscaled resolutions (e.g. 640x480 stretched to 2x/3x). It's highly recommended to also enable the "Scale HUD" option in SADX Mod Manager.
