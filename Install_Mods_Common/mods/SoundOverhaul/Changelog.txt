Note: Starting with version 0.8532 (October 22, 2019) Sound Overhaul 2 has an option to enable logarithic volume controls. This option makes sound effects louder and is technically more "correct" than default ingame volume adjustment. However, it does not adjust the volume of 3D sounds, which will be too quiet in comparison. To fix this, use a DirectSound wrapper called DSOAL (see link above), which will fix volume adjustment for 3D sounds.
