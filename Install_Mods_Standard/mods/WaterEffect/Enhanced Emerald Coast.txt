Enhanced Emerald Coast mod by PkR

This mod updates Emerald Coast with several fixes and enhancements. The mod is based on the original SADX PC level and does not restore the Dreamcast version of the level.

This mod will not work with Dreamcast mods. If you want a similar-looking ocean for Dreamcast Emerald Coast, use SADX Style Water. 
This mod is compatible with SADXFE if you list it after SADXFE in the Mod Manager.

The mod introduces the following enhancements to Emerald Coast:

-Higher-resolution ocean wave textures with proper tiling (texture and animation by SteG)
-Green ocean color from SADX Gamecube
-Wave effect during the whale chase from the Dreamcast version
-Improved fog distance (closer to the Gamecube version)
-Correct skybox scale for proper ocean alignment against the horizon
-In Act 2, the water in the second pool near the start point no longer has a visible gap on the right side
-In Act 3, the water in Big's secret area is properly aligned vertically and there are no ocean waves at the top of the cave
-Big's secret area has dynamic white fog similar to the Dreamcast version

Known issues:

-The water bubbles create a strange-looking ripple with missing textures when they reach the water surface (SADX bug)
-The ocean alignment fix causes a minor reduction in draw distance
-The ocean looks slightly different from the moment you enter the area right before the whale effect
-The ocean UVs don't scroll on the model that is used for the wave effect
