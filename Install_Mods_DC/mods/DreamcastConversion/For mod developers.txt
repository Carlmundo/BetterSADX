==Making edits for Dreamcast Conversion levels==
Make sure your SET file, PVM or texture pack has the _DC suffix (e.g. HIGHWAY01_DC.PVM) and load your mod after DC Conversion. SET file modifications will work if the "Optimized SET files" option is selected in Dreamcast Conversion options. They will not work with 1998/1999 SET files which use hardcoded paths.

==Editing title screen and main menu textures==
AVA_GTITLE0_DC_HD.PVMX in the textures folder contains title screen and main menu background assets for resolutions other than 640x480.
AVA_GTITLE0_DC.PVM in the system folder contains title screen assets for 640x480.
AVA_TITLE_BACK_DC.PVM in the system folder contains main menu backgrounds for 640x480.
AVA_TITLE_BACK_DC.PVM is only used at 640x480 and only for title screens without ripples (JP/US static and Limited Edition).
Animated title screens use AVA_GTITLE0_DC.PVM at 640x480 and AVA_GTITLE0_DC_HD.PVMX at other resolutions.

==Checking which levels are enabled in DC Conversion==
The mod exports a boolean array EnabledLevels, which can be used to check whether a specific level is enabled in the mod's configuration. There is also a boolean EnableDCTitleScreen, which is true when the Dreamcast title screen is enabled.

==Disabling DC Conversion levels from other mods==
You can also prevent each level's code from running at all if you write 0x90 (5 bytes) to the addresses below. This will work regardless of mod order.
