BetterSADX uses a very slight variation on the Dreamcast Edition mod by PkR and TheArcadeStriker.

1. It moves all mods into a subfolder called "DC_Edition"

2. It includes a version of the DC Branding Mod that only changes the intro sequence, and not the entire rest of the game menus and UI. The original DC branding mod has been removed as well.

3. In addition, we have removed "KillCream", and "DC_TornadoModels" because both of them can be considered a downgrade to an extent.

4. We removed ADX Voices because ADX voices come with BetterSADX natively.

5. We have moved "HD_DCStyle" into the common mods for BetterSADX since it's awesome.

6. We added DC_CameraAngles and DC_CharTextures. DC_CharTextures is a custom version of the seperate mod by PkR and TheArcadeStriker that attempts to restore the DC Character textures and sound effects from the Dreamcast version, however I split it because the SE files it had are of lower quality.

The mods that we have changed/removed can be obtained at these urls.
