HD GUI 2 mod by PkR, Dark Sonic and Jmtshaw

This mod provides high-resolution graphics for most ingame menus and GUI items.

Known glitch: some menu items may get cut off or display incorrectly before the character select screen is loaded, such as the songs in the sound test or the bottom right part of the file select screen. This is a Mod Loader bug that can't be fixed on my side.

Known compatibility issues and how to resolve them: 
Goal Ring mod by MainMemory: please load the Goal Ring mod after HD GUI.
XInput button prompts by CheatFreak: this mod overrides HD assets with standard resolution assets, no solution as of now other than disabling one of the mods.

Unless a mod is mentioned in the compatibility section, please load HD GUI AFTER all other GUI-related mods, including DC Branding!

HD GUI 2 works with and without Dreamcast mods. When used together with DC Branding, it will have some Dreamcast-like features, like the pause box gradient. The mod detects which other mods are enabled and switches to other texture packs if necessary (however, tutorials are Dreamcast style only at the moment). If the DC SubGames mod is not enabled, this mod will restore the UVs on some Sky Chase models since the texture pack for Sky Chase (that includes the Tornado life gauge) uses unmirrored textures from the Dreamcast version.
