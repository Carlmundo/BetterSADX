HD GUI 2 mod by PkR and Dark Sonic

This mod provides high-resolution graphics for most ingame menus and GUI items.

Known glitch: some menu items may get cut off or display incorrectly before the character select screen is loaded, such as the songs in the sound test or the bottom right part of the file select screen. This is a Mod Loader bug that can't be fixed on my side.

Please load this mod AFTER all other GUI-related mods, including DC Branding!

HD GUI 2 works with and without Dreamcast mods. When used together with DC Branding, it will have some Dreamcast-like features, like the pause box gradient. The mod detects which other mods are enabled and switches to other texture packs if necessary. If the DC SubGames mod is not enabled, this mod will restore the UVs on some Sky Chase models since the texture pack for Sky Chase (that includes the Tornado life gauge) uses unmirrored textures from the Dreamcast version.
